                <p>
                    Having worked with leading names and startups, we were constantly put through the rigorous and daunting task of managing social media.
                    Though most activities were outsourced, managing and crafting tangible results was painstakingly time taking. Number crunching, stats, math and
                    a whole lot of Microsoft excel made us think of improving the <b>general experience</b> of a brand.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    On a detailed analysis, we figured out that smaller companies, startups and micro-brands lacked knowledge, resources and the much needed financial
                    bandwidth. They had a different set of needs with some overlap with what the brands and larger enterprise needed.

                        A quote from Jim Morrison, the lead singer of a band "The Doors" gave us the right direction.
                        <br />
                        The quote said... <b>THE ONES WHO CONTROL MEDIA, CONTROL MINDS.</b> From there began our conquest to design and craft something that lets brands
                        and microbrands  manage their present needs vis-a-vis social media effectively. The solution had to be something that scales up to assists in several
                        marketing decision making.
