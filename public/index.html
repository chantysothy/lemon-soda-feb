                                    Having worked with leading names and startups, we were constantly put through the rigorous and daunting task of managing social media.
                                    Though most activities were outsourced, managing and crafting tangible results was painstakingly time taking. Number crunching, stats, math and
                                    a whole lot of Microsoft excel made us think of improving the <b>general experience</b> of a brand.

                                    On a detailed analysis, we figured out that smaller companies, startups and micro-brands lacked knowledge, resources and the much needed financial
                                    bandwidth. They had a different set of needs with some overlap with what the brands and larger enterprise needed.

                                    Each day there are hundred of websites that get created. From simple things like sharing photos, videos, experience and a whole lot more 
                                    services that are now being provided online.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Some make it, the rest get back to the grind. On carefully analysing, we concluded our analysis with a thought that the means to reach the 
                                    correct audience at the right time, in the right frame was the most critical aspect of what ever, anyone is doing.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    So, we began this journey called "nectorr" with a few dollars and crafted a subset of the entire offering that could make a huge impact to 
                                    whatever you are doing using multiple online social medium.
