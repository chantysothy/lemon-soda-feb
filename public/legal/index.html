                        <p>Nectorr respects the intellectual property rights of others and wishes to offer Services that contain no content that violates those rights. 
                        <br /><br />Our Terms of Service (published <a href="https://nectorr.com/legal">here</a>  (“Terms of Service”) require that information posted by users 
                        be accurate, lawful and not in violation of the rights of third parties. 
                        <br /><br />Nectorr has adopted this Copyright & IP Infringement Policy to explain to Nectorr users and third parties their rights and responsibilities 
                        regarding copyright of the user content uploaded through our Services and the actions that Nectorr will take in response to copyright complaints. 
                        <br /><br />
                            It is Nectorr’s policy, in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who repeatedly infringe or are repeatedly charged with infringing the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others.
                        <br /><br />
                            The process outlined in this Policy is designed to be consistent with the process suggested by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 
                        (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, http://www.copyright.gov). 
                        Remember that your use of Nectorr’s Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Service, which incorporate this 
                        Copyright & IP Infringement Policy.  Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of 
                        Service [either the Nectorr Terms of Service, or in the Nectorr Enterprise Terms of Service].

                            Nectorr wants to ensure that we are doing the right thing when we are asked to remove content from our Services.
                            Only copyright owners (or owners of other IP, as defined below) can report a suspected infringement to Nectorr.
                            Therefore, you cannot report a suspected infringement if you are not the copyright or IP owner (or an authorized representative).
                            Please be aware that you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by Nectorr or our users,
                            if you knowingly materially misrepresent that content published through the Services is infringing your copyright or other IP.
                            When in doubt, you should consult an attorney. If you do conclude that your copyrights or other IP rights are being infringed,
                            you can follow the process outlined in this policy to report it to us. We also strongly encourage you to contact the user directly.

                            If your content has been removed by Nectorr, and you believe that the content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or you believe that you have the authorization to post and use such content from the copyright owner, or the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, you may send Nectorr a counter-notice (“Counter-Notice”) to the address of the Designated Agent listed above. Your Counter-Notice must contain the following information:
                            <br /><br />1.	Identification the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;

                            <br /><br />4.	Your physical or electronic signature.
                            <br /><br />Once a proper Counter-Notice is received, Nectorr may, in our sole discretion, send a copy of the Counter-Notice to the original complaining party informing them that Nectorr may replace the removed content (or restore access to it) 10 business days after our Designated Agent received the Counter-Notice, or any time thereafter. At Nectorr’s discretion, the removed content may be replaced (or access to it restored) 10 business days after receipt of the Counter-Notice, or any time thereafter, unless our Designated Agent first receives notice that a court action has been filed to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity related to the removed or disabled content.
                            <br /><br />If you believe that some other IP right of yours (or of someone on whose behalf you are authorized to act) is being infringed by a user, please provide a Notice to Nectorr’s Designated Agent (as specified above) with the following information:

                            <br /><br />3.	Identification of the IP alleged to have been infringed, including (i) a complete description or explanation of the nature of the IP, (ii) evidence that you (or someone on whose behalf you are authorized to act) own the IP in the relevant jurisdiction, including copies of relevant patents, registrations, certifications or other documentary evidence of your ownership, and (iii) a showing sufficient for Nectorr to determine without unreasonable effort that the IP has been infringed;
                            <br /><br />4.	Information reasonably sufficient to permit Nectorr to identify the use being challenged; and
                            <br /><br />5.	Both of the following statements in the body of the Notice:
                            <br /><br />“I hereby state that I have not authorized the challenged use, and I have a good- faith belief that the challenged use is not authorized by law.”
                            <br /><br />“I hereby state under penalty of perjury that all of the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the owner of the IP, or authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the IP.”
                            <br /><br />Upon receipt of the notice as described above, Nectorr will seek to confirm the existence of the IP on our Services, notify the user who posted the content including the IP, and take whatever action, in its sole discretion, we deem appropriate, including temporary or permanent removal of the IP from our Services.

Nectorr may also use Customer Content for the purpose of supporting and developing the Services, provided that when doing so, Nectorr shall only use Customer Content in an anonymized and aggregated way. Subject only to the limited license expressly granted herein, you and your Authorized Users shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Customer Content and all intellectual property rights therein.

                                4.1 Purchases By Authorization Form. If an Authorization Form is issued for the purchase of Services, you agree to pay all fees as and when described per the Authorization Form(s). Nectorr shall invoice you for the fees in the currency set forth on the applicable Authorization Form. Unless otherwise stated on the Authorization Form, all invoices shall be payable within 30 days of the invoice date. Any disputed amounts shall not affect payment of non-disputed amounts. You shall make payments to the entity and address set forth in the invoice.
                                <br /><br />
                                4.2 Online Paid Services.  For paid Services purchased online (“Online Services”), you must provide Nectorr with a valid credit card or other payment method  (e.g., PayPal account) to pay for such services. Some Services may be available as a one-time purchase, and others can be purchased as a monthly or yearly subscription. You agree that Nectorr has permission to retain and/or share with financial institutions and payment processing firms (including any institutions or firms Nectorr retains in the future) your submitted payment information in order to process your purchase. Depending on where you transact with us, the type of payment method used and where your payment method was issued, your transaction with us may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices, including because of exchange rates. Nectorr does not support all payment methods, currencies, or locations for payment. If the payment method you use with us, such as a credit card, reaches its expiration date and you do not edit your payment method information or cancel or downgrade your account to a charge-free account, you authorize Nectorr to continue billing your credit card and/or PayPal account and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. All applicable taxes are calculated based on the billing information you provide us at the time of purchase.

                                4.3 Free Trial Period. If you sign up for a free trial period for a Service that is subject to charges (the “Free Trial”), we may require you to provide us with a valid credit card or other valid payment method. We may start charging you automatically on the first day after the Free Trial is over, unless you cancel or downgrade to a charge-free Service and uninstall any Apps or other items, as required for cancellation, before the end of the Free Trial period. Please note that prior to the end of the Free Trial Apps purchased via the Nectorr App Directory may need to be uninstalled via the App Directory to avoid charges being incurred. The Free Trial is only available to first time users of a paid Online Service.
                                <br /><br />
                                4.4 Subscription Services; Auto-renewal and Cancellation.  If you are purchasing Online Services on a subscription basis, you may have the option to purchase a monthly or a yearly subscription, which will automatically renew at the end of its applicable term. Subscriptions are billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis (as per the option chosen when you purchased such Online Services) and are non-refundable for the subscription period they are purchased for. You agree that Nectorr may process your credit card or other valid payment method on each monthly, annual, or other renewal term (based on the applicable billing cycle), on the calendar day corresponding to the first day you subscribed to Online Services. If your paid subscription to Online Services began on a day not contained in a subsequent month (e.g., your service began on January 30 and there is no February 30), we will process your payment on the last day of such month. You may elect to cancel or downgrade your Online Services at any time by following the steps outlined here. Apps purchased via the Nectorr App Directory must be uninstalled separately via the App Directory to avoid charges being incurred. If you subscribed to a monthly plan, your account may immediately be downgraded to a charge-free account, but no credit will be issued for any prepaid fees. If you subscribed to a yearly plan, the downgrade will only be effective at the end of the then-current annual billing period and no credits or refunds will be issued to you for prepaid fees. Online Services purchased for a one-time fee (such as Academy certifications) are not refundable.
                                <br /><br />
                                4.5 Late Payment. If any amounts due hereunder are not received by Nectorr by the due date, then at Nectorr’s discretion, such charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 12% per year or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was due until the date paid. In addition, upon 10 days' written notice, Nectorr may suspend your access to the Services if Nectorr does not receive the amounts invoiced hereunder at the expiration of such period.
                                <br /><br />
                                4.6 Taxes and Withholdings. You are responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your purchase of Services. If Nectorr has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this section, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by you, unless you provide Nectorr with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. Any and all payments by or on account of the compensation payable under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes. If you are required to deduct or withhold any Taxes from such payments, then the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that, after making all required deductions or withholdings, Nectorr receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
